This is the living, web-native companion to the book **Data as Foundation**.  
Use it to explore:

- **Data vs Information Governance** — why compliance isn’t capability.
- **Metadata as the missing linchpin** — context that preserves meaning.
- **Semantic interoperability in practice** — implementable semantics for real teams.
- **Repurposing, not reuse** — moving data safely across contexts.
