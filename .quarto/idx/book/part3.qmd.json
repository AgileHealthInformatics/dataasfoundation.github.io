Each demands different quality thresholds and exposes hidden biases if context is missing.\n\nIt then argues that **data is a dynamic asset**. Its value appreciates through use: relationships are formed, interpretations layered, quality refined, and metadata enriched. Treating data as “at rest” underestimates both risk and opportunity. Governance must therefore be **evolutionary**—tracking lineage, propagating corrections upstream, and reassessing value and quality as purposes change.\n\nThe takeaway is pragmatic: replace “copy once, use everywhere” with “**transform deliberately, prove fitness**.” Build shared transformation components, document them like code, measure semantic completeness (not just format compliance), and publish provenance with outputs.
