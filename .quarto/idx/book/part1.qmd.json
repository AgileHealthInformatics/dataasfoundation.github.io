The paradox is that we have standards, frameworks and budgets, yet meaning still fractures as information crosses organisational and system boundaries.\n\nThe narrative starts with NHS history: departmental systems in the 1990s, the ambition of NPfIT, and later waves favouring local innovation. Each era improved tooling, but too often **assumed** that consistent, high-quality data would naturally follow. In practice, variation in coding, local extensions, and undocumented context created a brittleness that no amount of messaging middleware could fix. Technical interoperability advanced faster than **semantic** interoperability.\n\nThe part names a persistent confusion: **information governance** (lawful, secure handling) is not **data governance** (stewardship of meaning, quality and lifecycle). Organisations passed audits yet struggled to use shared data safely because definitions, provenance and quality were unclear. COVID-era acceleration amplified this: where foundations existed, analytics and coordination flourished; where they didn’t, dashboards and decision support were hampered by inconsistency and missing context.\n\nA second thread is the **metadata gap**. Clinical terminologies (e.g., SNOMED CT), classifications and modern exchange standards are necessary but insufficient without operational metadata that records *how* data was captured, by whom, using what method, with which units and reference ranges. Without it, repurposing for research, quality, or AI becomes risky guesswork.\n\nPart I concludes with a call to action: treat data capability as distinct from digitisation. Establish senior data leadership; fund metadata infrastructure (registries, lineage, quality services); and measure **data management maturity** alongside system adoption. The lesson from decades of effort is not to spend less on digital—but to **sequence and govern** differently so technology sits on bedrock, not sand.\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n<div class=\"book-cover-left\">\n  <a href=\"https://amzn.eu/d/enJozBL\" target=\"_blank\">\n    <img src=\"../images/cover.png\" alt=\"Data as Foundation book cover\">\n  </a>\n  <p>\n    <a href=\"https://amzn.eu/d/enJozBL\" target=\"_blank\">Buy on Amazon</a>\n  </p>\n</div>\n\n\nPart I investigates why health systems repeatedly invest in digital programmes that promise transformation yet deliver only partial gains.
