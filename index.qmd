## Vision

To create healthcare information systems that are transparent, interoperable, and continuously learning.
*Data as Foundation* envisions a future where every clinical, operational, and research decision is grounded in trusted data — seamlessly connected through shared meaning, robust governance, and intelligent architecture that evolves with healthcare itself.

## The Data as Foundation Philosophy

*Data as Foundation* is built on the belief that data is not a by-product of healthcare but its essential infrastructure.
It proposes five interlocking principles.

- **Meaning before technology**: Shared semantics and metadata allow systems to change without losing understanding.
- **Governance as capability**: Stewardship of data quality, provenance, and context ensures that information can be safely reused and repurposed.
- **Architecture as alignment**: Enterprise architecture connects people, processes, and platforms around a coherent model of meaning rather than a single technology stack.
- **Metadata as infrastructure**: Registries and definitions provide the connective tissue linking data to its clinical and operational context.
- **Intelligence through integrity**: Trustworthy AI depends on trustworthy data — explainable, traceable, and grounded in evidence.

Together, these principles create an ecosystem where data flows confidently, decisions are transparent, and improvement becomes a property of the system itself.
