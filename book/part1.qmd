Part I investigates why health systems repeatedly invest in digital programmes that promise transformation yet deliver only partial gains. The central claim is stark: **we optimised visible technology while neglecting the invisible foundation**—data governance, metadata, and shared semantics. The paradox is that we have standards, frameworks and budgets, yet meaning still fractures as information crosses organisational and system boundaries.

The narrative starts with NHS history: departmental systems in the 1990s, the ambition of NPfIT, and later waves favouring local innovation. Each era improved tooling, but too often **assumed** that consistent, high-quality data would naturally follow. In practice, variation in coding, local extensions, and undocumented context created a brittleness that no amount of messaging middleware could fix. Technical interoperability advanced faster than **semantic** interoperability.

The part names a persistent confusion: **information governance** (lawful, secure handling) is not **data governance** (stewardship of meaning, quality and lifecycle). Organisations passed audits yet struggled to use shared data safely because definitions, provenance and quality were unclear. COVID-era acceleration amplified this: where foundations existed, analytics and coordination flourished; where they didn’t, dashboards and decision support were hampered by inconsistency and missing context.

A second thread is the **metadata gap**. Clinical terminologies (e.g., SNOMED CT), classifications and modern exchange standards are necessary but insufficient without operational metadata that records *how* data was captured, by whom, using what method, with which units and reference ranges. Without it, repurposing for research, quality, or AI becomes risky guesswork.

Part I concludes with a call to action: treat data capability as distinct from digitisation. Establish senior data leadership; fund metadata infrastructure (registries, lineage, quality services); and measure **data management maturity** alongside system adoption. The lesson from decades of effort is not to spend less on digital—but to **sequence and govern** differently so technology sits on bedrock, not sand.
