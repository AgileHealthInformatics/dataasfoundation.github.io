This part connects foundations to the frontier. It starts with **Foundations for AI**: trustworthy systems require governed data, explicit semantics, lineage, and human-in-the-loop oversight. Generative tools add capability but increase the need for documented context, prompt/response traceability, and model risk management aligned to emerging standards.

Next is **Data Management Maturity**. Digital maturity (features, adoption) is not the same as capability maturity (definitions, stewardship, quality, metadata, lifecycle). A practical maturity model lets organisations baseline where they are, prioritise gaps, and invest sequentially—often starting with stewardship, registries, and quality services that unlock downstream value faster than another app rollout.

Finally, **The Cultural Shift**. Durable change is behavioural: moving from ownership to **stewardship**, from gatekeeping to **clarity**, and from individual heroics to **systematic improvement**. Leaders signal priorities by funding foundations, publishing definitions, and celebrating quality wins. Literacy matters too: clinicians and managers don’t need to be ontologists, but they do need shared language about meaning, quality and risk.

The message is hopeful: with foundations in place, AI augments clinical judgment, analytics informs planning, and information flows safely through a governed ecosystem. Without them, every innovation amplifies inconsistency.
